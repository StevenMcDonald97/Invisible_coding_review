A basic javascript function, built using typescript, for logging the current weather and time for given locations. The function getWeatherForAll(locations) takes an input of type string[] representing location identifiers, and logs the current weather and time at each location using the OpenWeatherMap API. The only recognized locations identifiers are zip codes and city names, all other entries will log a message that the data could not be found.
